# BADBIR Research Samples and Access Information

## What This Repository Contains
This repository serves as a public index and guide for the **BADBIR Research Samples** project. The full project resources include:

- **Dummy Data**: Synthetic datasets (CSV, Stata) that mimic the structure of real BADBIR data without containing real patient information.
- **Analysis Code**: Example scripts (R, Python, Stata) for cleaning, linking, and analyzing BADBIR-style data.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive data dictionaries and variable definitions.

## How It Can Help You
These resources are designed to assist researchers, statisticians, and clinicians in:
1. **Training & Familiarization**: Learn the structure of BADBIR data before applying for access to real datasets.
2. **Code Development**: Write and test analysis scripts on dummy data to ensure readiness for real data analysis.
3. **Reproducibility**: Use standardized code templates to ensure consistent and reproducible research outputs.
